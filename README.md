# Game Rules
The game is played with two players.
Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die.
On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they wish to accumulate points for their turn.
If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during their turn, and the turn ends.
A player can choose to "hold," which means their turn ends, and their accumulated points are added to their total score.
The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

# Features
Two-player mode
Simple, interactive web-based interface
Score tracking for both players
Option to continue rolling or hold
